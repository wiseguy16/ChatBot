# ChatBot
ChatBot is an app that demonstrates how to send and receive messages to the ChatGPT AI by using their api. It allows the user to switch between the davinci-003 and curie-001 AI models. The davinci-003 is the most capable model, while the curie-001 model is faster and lower cost, just not as powerful.
